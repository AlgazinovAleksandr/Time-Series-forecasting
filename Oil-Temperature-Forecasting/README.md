The goal of this project is to compare classical and deep learning based time series forecasting methods. We want to figure out, whether neural networks (like lstm, seq2seq, transformer) can outperform the classical methods (like ARIMA and prophet) on the pretty standard-looking time series data without the need for multiple experiments with different architecture, and the long process of hyperparameter tuning.

While it is clear that results vary from dataset to dataset, we can still conclude that at least on the standard time series data (nearly stationary, with seasonality), the classical methods are still very competitive. The deep learning models are often not able to capture the seasonality and trend in the data, and the results are not as good as the classical methods. However, when the architecture is properly selected, and the hyperparameters are tuned, the deep learning models can outperform the classical methods. Moreover, if the data looks very different from the standard time series data, the deep learning models can be more effective.

We will perform our experiments on the ETT dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ett). The dataset is also used as a benchmark, so it can be used to check which models proposed by the community performed the best on it.
