Time series is one the common data structures in Data Science problems. Due to the nature of the data, where we look at one object over a period of time, many special statistical methods were invented for forecasting time series. In this project, we will dive deeper and consider a multi time series (panel data) problem. Despite that models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and ARIMAX very designed specially for time series, many researhers still use classical Machine Learning methods, such as gradient boosting, for solving these problems. Therefore, I want to understand when it is necessary to go beyond statistical methods and use more complex approaches. Also I will try to answer the question, whether it makes sense to use statistical models ever at all

In this project, there will be several jupyter notebooks:
