This repository consists of two projects:

Oil-Temperature-Forecasting: The goal of this project is to compare classical and deep learning based time series forecasting methods. We want to figure out, whether neural networks (like lstm, seq2seq, transformer) can outperform the classical methods (like ARIMA and prophet) on the pretty standard-looking time series data without the need for multiple experiments with different architecture, and the long process of hyperparameter tuning.

Property-Sales-Forecasting: Due to the nature of the time series data, when we look at one object over a period of time, many special statistical methods were invented for forecasting time series. In this project, we will dive deeper and consider a multi time series (panel data) problem. Despite that models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and ARIMAX very designed specially for time series, many researhers still use classical Machine Learning methods, such as gradient boosting, for solving these problems. Therefore, I want to understand when it is necessary to go beyond statistical methods and use more complex approaches. Also I will try to answer the question, whether it makes sense to use statistical models ever at all.

Hence, these two projects give the opportunity to compare different approaches to time series forecasting and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each. Moreover, they help to understand, which methods are preferred in which cases.
